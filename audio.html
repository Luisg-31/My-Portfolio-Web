                I decided to base my project based on preparing to get ready for a party. I had several of ideas of
                project but had to be cut down because I didn’t want it to be too lengthy. For the recorded voicemail, I
                applied a filter curve EQ preset called ‘telephone’ which gave it that old landline feel. For the city
                ambience and music I used a low pass filter and added some effects like reverb to make it sound as it's
                coming from another room.
